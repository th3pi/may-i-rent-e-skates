## MathTank

#### is an android quiz game based on Java. My first android application. The idea of it is to improve quick math skills, to train user's brain to solve math problems quickly and easily - by looking for patterns.

# Features!

  - User friendly colorful UI
  - Robust settings that lets user customize pretty much everything.
  - Randomly generated math problems with patterns - where user use their common sense to solve not math skills.
  - Fitting sound tracks to help user concentrate more.
  - Dark mode
  - 3 different game modes
  - Ads

# Tech used
- Java
- Android Studio
- Admob
- Firebase
- Parse



#### The homepage page has a nice animated background with a soothing soundtrack playing in the background to give user a very chill vibe, to calm their brain. There are three game modes.
![homepage](https://i.imgur.com/lgDcGme.jpg)



# 1. Quick Maths Shark
#### Every mode has their own loading screen with tips and tricks showed while the counter counts down.
![quickmathsloading](https://i.imgur.com/ps194v4.jpg)

#### Quick Maths - where user are given an equation and user have to select whether the equation is right or wrong. User solve as many randomly generated problems as user wish within 30 seconds. User is given both physical (vibration) and visual feedback (text feedback and button wiggle-if wrong) based on userr answer.
![quickmaths](https://i.imgur.com/AedAcpo.jpg)
#### Background color changes based on the timer to further tense the situation and give user a sense of rush.
![quickmathstimerunningout](https://i.imgur.com/L9rfyrT.jpg)

#### At the end of each game user is given a result sheet which gives feedback on how they performed based on an average metric. The metric is different for each game modes.
![scoremetric](https://i.imgur.com/0tUcbvZ.jpg)


# 2. Time trials Shark
#### In this game mode, user is given 8 seconds to answer each question. There is no time limit, however questions only get harder. Timer resets after each correct answer. The same feedback mechanics for each question apply to this game mode as well. User is given both visual and physical feedback based on their answers.
![timetrials](https://i.imgur.com/WGmD6H1.jpg)
![timetrials2](https://i.imgur.com/WJZkbqu.jpg)

# 3. Advanced Shark
#### Advanced shark is for those who really want a challenge. This game asks user the hard questions, however still maintaining a pattern so that user don't have to do as much math as just using common sense. Which is really the main point of this app. Advanced shark introduces square root, square and cube problems as well as upping the difficulty by making equations longer. No time limit in advanced shark. User go on for as long as user like, whenever user feel like user are done - just click on the timer and the session will end. A score card will be displayed letting user know how user did.

![adshark](https://i.imgur.com/gQ8gvGY.jpg)
![adshark2](https://i.imgur.com/0tUcbvZ.jpg)

# Settings
#### This app includes a very powerful settings menu. User can customize the look of the app(dark mode), music, difficulty of questions and what kind of questions user get.
#### Kids mode makes all the problems very easy - great to let kids learn and practice quick maths.
#### User can enable dark mode if user're not feeling very bright and happy for some reason.
#### User can practice specific type of problems if user feel like user need more practice at it. The app will automatically start showing more problems that user're weak at. But if user feel like user only want that specific set of problems - user have the option.
